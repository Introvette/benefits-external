      Permanent full-time employees are covered by a defined plan with the North
      Carolina Teacher's and State Employees' Retirement System. Employees are
      required to contribute 6% of their monthly salary through a payroll
      deduction. Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools also contributes on your behalf
      to the State Retirement System in an amount that is legislated annually.
      Your contributions are paid with pre-tax dollars, thereby reducing current
      state and federal income taxes.

      Retirees will be auto-enrolled into a health plan regardless of their
      contribution status. If they do not want coverage, it is necessary to opt
      out during the retirement process by calling 855-859-0966 or going online.
      Depending on the retiree's situation at the time of retirement, they will
      need to take this into consideration regarding their State Health Plan
      coverage.
