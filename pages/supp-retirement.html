    <p>
      Supplemental retirement income is the amount of income a retiree earns on
      top of the income he receives from Social Security and pension payments.
      Eligible employees can save for retirement by making pre-tax contributions
      to a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 plan or after-tax contributions to a Roth
      403(b) or Roth 457 plan.
